# Part 1 - Implementing multisets in Haskell

This assignment requires you to implement a type constructor providing the functionalities of Multisets. Your implementation must be based on the following concrete Haskell definition of the ListBag type constructor:

*data ListBag a = LB [(a, Int)]*
  *deriving (Show, Eq)*
  
Therefore a ListBag contains a list of pairs whose first component is the actual element of the multiset, and the second component is its multiplicity, that is the number of occurrences of such element in the multiset. A ListBag is well-formed if it does not contain two pairs (v, k) and (v', k') with v = v'.

**Exercise 1: Constructors and operations**
The goal of this exercise is to write an implementation of multisets represented concretely as elements of the type constructor ListBag. As described below, the proposed implementation must be well documented and must pass the provided tests.

Using the type constructor ListBag described above, implement the predicate wf that applied to a ListBag returns True if and only if the argument is well-formed. Check that the inferred type is wf :: Eq a => ListBag a -> Bool.

*Important: All the operations of the present exercise that return a ListBag bag must ensure that the result is well-formed, i.e., that wf bag == True.*

Implement the following constructors:
- empty, that returns an empty ListBag
- singleton v, returning a ListBag containing just one occurrence of element v
- fromList lst, returning a ListBag containing all and only the elements of lst, each with the right multiplicity

Implement the following operations:
- isEmpty bag, returning True if and only if bag is empty
- mul v bag, returning the multiplicity of v in the ListBag bag if v is an element of bag, and 0 otherwise
- toList bag, that returns a list containing all the elements of the ListBag bag, each one repeated a number of times equal to its multiplicity
- sumBag bag bag', returning the ListBag obtained by adding all the elements of bag' to bag

**Testing:** The attached files testEx1.hs and testEx12.hs contain some tests that can be used to check the correctness of the implemented functions. To run the tests, it is probably necessary to install the Test.HUnit Haskell module. Next it is sufficient to load file testEx1.hs or testEx12.hs in the interpreter, and execute main.

*Note that solutions that do not pass such tests will not be evaluated, and a revision will be requested.*

**Solution format:** A Haskell source file called Ex1.hs containing a Module (see Section "Making our own modules") called Ex1, defining the data type ListBag (copy it from above) and at least all the functions described above. The module can include other functions as well, if convenient. *Note: The file has to be adequately commented, and each function definition must be preceded by its type, as inferred by the Haskell compiler.*



**Exercise 2: Mapping and folding**
The goal of this exercise is to experiment with class constructors by adding some functions to the module developed for Exercise 1.

- Define an instance of the constructor class Foldable for the constructor ListBag defined in Exercise 1. To this aim, choose a minimal set of functions to be implemented, as described in the documentation of Foldable. Intuitively, folding a ListBag with a binary function should apply the function to the elements of the multiset, ignoring the multiplicities.
- Define a function mapLB that takes a function f :: a -> b and a ListBag of type a as an argument, and returns the ListBag of type b obtained by applying f to all the elements of its second argument.
- Explain (in a comment in the same file) why it is not possible to define an instance of Functor for ListBag by providing mapLB as the implementation of fmap.

**Solution format:** A Haskell source file Ex2.hs containing a module called Ex2, which imports module Ex1 and includes only the new functions defined for this exercise. *Note: The file has to be adequately commented, and each function definition has to be preceded by its type, as inferred by the Haskell compiler.*



# Part 2 - A Map-Reduce framework exploiting the Java Stream API

The Map-Reduce paradigm is widely used for processing huge amounts of data in a parallel and distributed setting. In this assigment, students are required to implement a simple software framework providing the functionalities of Map-Reduce, but ignoring the aspects of parallelism and distribution. As a proof of concept, two simple working instances of the framework should be implemented as well.

For an introduction to the Map-Reduce framework see the paper MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters. For a presentation of Map-Reduce as Software Framework, identifying the hot spots, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce#Dataflow (since we ignore the distribution aspects, you can ignore the Partition function.)

**Solution format:** An archive MapReduce-<yourSurname>.zip containing the Java files implementing Exercises 3 and 4.


**Exercise 3 - The framework**
Following the guidelines presented in the lesson of October 22 2019 and more specifically the Template Method design pattern, implement in Java a Map-Reduce software framework providing the functionalites described in the above documentation and respecting the following constraints:

- For key/value pairs, the framework must use the attached class Pair.java (you can change its package, but nothing else).
- The hot spots of the framework are the methods read, map, compare, reduce and write.
- The framework must use, when possible, the Stream API. For example, map takes a stream of key-value pairs as argument and returns a stream of key-value pairs (types of argument and result may differ, of course).


**Exercise 4 - Counting words**
By instantiating the framework, implement a program that counts the occurrences of words of length greater than 3 in a given set of documents, respecting the following constraints:

- The program should ask the user for the absolute path of the directory where documents are stored. Only files ending in .txt should be considered.
- The read function must return a stream of pairs (fileName, contents), where filename is the name of the text file and contents is a list of strings, one for each line of the file. For the read function you can exploit the enclosed class Reader.java in the way you prefer.
- The map function must take as input the output of read and must return a stream of pairs containing, for each word (of length greater than 3) in a line, the pair (w, k) where k is the number of occurrences of w in that line.
- The compare function should compare strings according to the standard alphanumeric ordering. (The result should adhere to the standard Java conventions, see the compareTo method of interface Comparable.)
- The reduce function takes as input a stream of pairs (w, lst) where w is a string and lst is a list of integers. It returns a corresponding stream of pairs (w, sum) where sum is the sum of the integers in lst.
- The write function takes as input the output of reduce and writes the stream in a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file, one pair per line, in alphanumeric ordering. For the write function you can exploit the enclosed class Writer.java in the way you prefer.

For testing the program you can use the enclosed archive Books.zip which contains parts of some famous books as downloaded from the pages of the Gutenberg Project.



# Part 3 - Benchmarking functions in Python, with Multithreading

You want now to benchmark your Python functions and you want to make sure that it is done in the right way (hopefullyâ€¦ :P)

**Solution format:** A single Python file called benchmark.py containing the solutions to the following three exercises.


**Exercise 6 - A decorator for benchmarking**

Define a Python decorator called benchmark. When invoking a function fun decorated by benchmark, fun is executed possibly several times (discarding the results) and a small table is printed on the standard output including the average time of execution and the variance.

The exact behaviour of the benchmark decorator is ruled by the following optional parameters:

- warmups: The number of warm-up invokations to fun (i.e. invokations whose timing must be ignored) (default: warmups = 0);
- iter: The number of times fun must be invoked and whose timing must be taken into account for the final metrics (default: iter = 1);
- verbose: Whether the execution should be verbose (i.e. if it must print the timing of each warm-up round and invokation) or not (default verbose = False);
- csv_file: A CSV file name where the benchmark information must be written. The header of the file will be in the form run num, is warmup, timing with the intuitive meaning (default csv_file = None, meaning that the benchmark information is only displayed on screen).


**Exercise 7 - Testing the decorator with multithreading**

Test your implementation by also evaluating the effectiveness of multhitreading in Python.

Using the threading module of the Standard Library and exploiting the benchmark decorator, write a function test that executes a function f (passed as parameter) with varying numbers of iterations and degrees of parallelism. More preciselsy, the test first runs f 16 times on a single thread, then 8 times on two threads, then 4 times on 4 threads, and finally 2 times on 8 threads. The program must write the benchmarking information for the four scenarions in corresponding files named f_<numthreads>_<numiterations>.

Run the program using a function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number in the standard, inefficent, double recursive way (choose n carefully) .

Discuss briefly the results in a comment in the Python file.

**Exercise 8 - [Optional] Downloading and executing Python scripts**
Define another decorator called prepost taking as parameters two URLs, the first indicating the location of a Python script to be executed before the function being decorated, the second denoting the location of a Python script to be executed after the function being decorated.

* Hint: Use the requests library to download the scripts (it is not part of the Standard Library, so you might need to install it, depending on the Python distribution you are using). You can download the scripts to temporary files, and then use os.system(.) to execute them invoking the Python interpreter. *
