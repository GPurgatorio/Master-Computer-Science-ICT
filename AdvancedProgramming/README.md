# Advanced Programming

This course focuses heavily on understanding what happens under the hood of programming languages.
Once this is done, 3 main langs are chosen: Java, Haskell, and Python.

In the folders, it's possible to see the various assignments, which were divided into two parts:

- **Assignment 1** Contains Java code about reflection, methods invocation, annotations, and a graphical drone-simulator *(see Assignment1/README.md)*
- **Assignment 2** Contains a definition of multisets in Haskell, a decorator *benchmark* in Python and a (sequential) MapReduce framework in Java, using Streams and Lambdas *(see Assignment2/README.md)*
