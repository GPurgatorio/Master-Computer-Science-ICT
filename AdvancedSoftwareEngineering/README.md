# Advanced Software Engineering

The course's main topics are presented in the *ASE Syllabus.pdf*.
In the folders, it's possible to see the various assignments, which are:

- **Homework 1** A simple quiz-like web service, to approach Python and Flask *(see HW1.pdf)*
- **Homework 2** A monolithic social-like web service, called *Dice with Rolls (see HW2.pdf)*
- **Homework 3** The microservice-version of the previous assignment *(see HW3.pdf)*
- **Problog** Just a backup of some code we tested in class, wasn't used in the final exam

Briefly, *Dice with Rolls* is a social network where you can register, login, create posts and react to them *(like, dislike, love, etc.)*.
The main idea behind this is that to create a post you must first roll some dice of a chosen theme *(Halloween, etc.)*: your post must be a story containing the keywords related to the dice that were rolled. Of course, you may reroll as much as you like before posting.
