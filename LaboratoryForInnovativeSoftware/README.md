# Laboratory For Innovative Software (2019-2020)

At the moment this repository is a backup of the produced code.
I might consider putting here also some resumes of the lectures, if I'll have time to do that.

**Note:** to run the exercises you should download [jsflow](http://www.jsflow.net/index.html)
Then simply install the dependencies with 'npm install' and ./jsflow \[optional_file\].

**Tips for Windows users:** I've installed the Ubuntu subsystem from the Windows Store.
*npm install* will usually trigger an error, the way to force its correct behavior is to:

```sh
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH"
$ source ~/.profile
```
