  - New/improved routing algorithms
     * added parametrization for MaxProp (default alpha=1)

       * see Karvo and Ott, Time Scales and Delay-Tolerant Routing Protocols,
         CHANTS 2008, for more information.

       immediately and deletes all replicas from buffers when the message is
       delivered
     * added maximum meeting probability set size support for MaxProp to improve
       its performance in scenarios with many nodes
  - Added MessageReport class for reporting message deliveries,
    CreatedMessagesReport for message creations and EventLogReport for
    reporting everything (in a StandardEventsReader-compatible format)
  - Added application layer
     * applications can be created by extending the Application class
     * multiple applications can run in the nodes
     * report modules can register for application events
     * see PingApplication and PingAppReporter for an example

    files for this movement model


Version 1.1.0 (6 May 2008)
- External Events Interface which allows event generator classes that
  can generate external events (such as creating new messages or
  setting up and tearing down connections). See EventQueueHandler
  class for details.

      createNewMessage method)

      distributed message creation patterns
    - new event: ConnectionEvent (supported by StandardEventsReader)

- Option to automatically delete messages that are already delivered
  to the final recipient

  already succeeded when the connection has gone down
- Connection class has now getTransferDoneTime method
- Settings class can validate range settings (assertValidRange)

  register to the "resetting service" at DTNSim class

- Experimental "update scheduling" functionality that can be used to
  dynamically insert "update points" between time steps for higher
  precision simulations
- DTN2 connectivity (requires JDK 6 or higher)
- Generic property adding feature for Message class (addProperty,
  getProperty and updateProperty)
   - SprayAndWait router uses this now for the copy count
- New tests

  up time.
