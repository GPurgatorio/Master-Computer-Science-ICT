# Master Curriculum "ICT Solutions Architect", Computer Science (University of Pisa)

This repository will contain most of the stuff I've used to prepare the various exams of my Master's Degree. 
The main idea is that it may be helpful to others, in order to know what is presented in this course or maybe a bit of help to prepare one or more exams.

Every repository will have its ReadMe file, so take in mind to read that before jumping straight to the codes or stuff.

Hoping that this will help you in some ways, I'll leave you with my favorite CS quote.

*"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."*
