<p>The ICT world is changing (and will keep changing beyond the last time these notes were updated) and a lot of axioms about its infrastructures are becoming outdated. A couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a few years ago it was known that the main bandwidth bottleneck was the disk, and so a system&apos;s whole performance was evaluated with reference to disk usage, number of IOs operations and so on... This, nowadays, is false.  Just think of <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/11702/intel-introduces-new-ruler-ssd-for-servers">Intel Optane SSD</a> where the new SSD technology based on 3D NAND permits to write and read faster than previous SSD, and so we have to redesign the entire system accordingly. Additionally, nvRAM (non-volatile RAM) are becoming more of an industry standard. nvRAM is a storage module similar to the hard drive but much faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In application and server distribution. In the past many applications were managed on each server with a shared storage. Nowadays we have deploy a large application on server clusters (i.e. a server node composed of multiple units working together as one) with local storage, so new system to develop and manage distributed computing application is needed (Hadoop, Cassandra, Spark...).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="mume-header" id="cloud-computing-reference-model-module-2">Cloud Computing Reference Model [Module 2]</h1>

<p>Since the course revolves around Cloud Computing architectures, it is important to keep the following reference model of the cloud stack in mind:</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="./assets/referenceModel.png">
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Physical Layer [Module 3]</strong>: Foundation layer of the cloud infrastructure.<br>
The physical infrastructure supporting the operation of the cloud</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Layer [Module 4]</strong>: Abstracts physical resources and makes them appear as virtual resources. e.g. a physical server is partitioned into many virtual ones to use the hardware better.  The <em>High Performance Computing</em> model bypasses the virtual layer for performance reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Control Layer [Module 5]</strong>: Dynamic Resource configuration and allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration Layer [Module 6]</strong>: workflows for task automation.</li>
<li><strong>Service Layer [Module 6]</strong>: self-service portal/interface and service catalog. Allows cloud users to obtain the resources they need without knowing where they are allocated.</li>
<li><strong>Service Management [Module 9]</strong>: on operational and business level</li>
<li><strong>Business Continuity [Module 7]</strong>: Enables ensuring the availability of services in line with SLAs.<br>
e.g. <em>Backups</em> vs <em>Replicas</em>: doing a backup of 1 PB may be a problem.<br>
<em>Fault Tolerance</em>: I should be able to power off a server without anyone noticing it.<br>
<em>live migration</em>: upgrading the software or the firmware while the system is running.</li>
<li><strong>Security [Module 8]</strong>: Governance, Risk and compliance. Also things like GDPR, phishing, antivirus, firewalls and DoS Attacks..</li>
</ol>
<h1 class="mume-header" id="data-centers">Data centers</h1>

<p>We start the course with datacenter design, see how it is built to support current and future design considerations, scalability, etc.</p>
<p>A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. It generally includes redundant or backup components and infrastructure for power supply, data communications connections, environmental controls (e.g. air conditioning, fire suppression) and various security devices. A large data center is an industrial-scale operation using as much electricity as a small town.</p>
<p>On average there are only 6 person managing 1 million servers.<br>
Prefabricated group of racks, already cabled and cooled, are automatically inserted in the datacenter (POD - Point Of Delivery). If something is not working in the prefabricated, the specific server is shut down. If more than the 70% is not working the POD producer will simply change the entire unity.</p>
<p>The datacenter is a place where we concentrate IT system in order to reduce costs. Servers are demanding in terms of current, cooling and security.</p>
<h1 class="mume-header" id="design-and-architectures">Design and Architectures</h1>

<h2 class="mume-header" id="cooling">Cooling</h2>

<p>Today cooling is air based. Just the beginning for liquid cooling.<br>
The air pushed though the server gets a 10/15 degrees temperature augment.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="crac-computer-room-air-conditioner">CRAC: Computer Room Air Conditioner</h4>

<p>Popular in the &apos;90 (3-5KW/rack), but not very efficient in terms of energy consumption.<br>
There is a <em>floating floor</em>, under which all the cabling and the cooling is performed. The air goes up because of thermal convection where it gets caught, cooled and re-introduced.</p>
<p>Drawbacks are density (if we want to go dense this approach fails) and the absence of locality. No one is using this technique today.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/crac.png">
</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="hotcold-aisles">Hot/Cold aisles</h4>

<p>The building block of this architecture are hot and cold corridors, that optimize cooling efficiency.<br>
The <em>workload balancing</em> may be a problem: there can be the situation where a rack is hotter than the other depending on the workload, thus is difficult to module the amount of hot and cold air. In CRAC model the solution is pumping enough for the higher consumer.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/crac1.png">
</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="in-row-cooling">In-Row cooling</h4>

<p>In-row cooling technology is a type of air conditioning system commonly used in data centers (15-60 kW/rack) in which the cooling unit is placed between the server cabinets in a row for offering cool air to the server equipment more effectively.</p>
<p>In-row cooling systems use a horizontal airflow pattern utilizing hot aisle/cold aisle configurations and they only occupy one-half rack of row space without any additional side clearance space. Typically, each unit is about 12 inches wide by 42 inches deep.</p>
<p>These units may be a supplement to raised-floor cooling (creating a plenum to distribute conditioned air) or may be the primary cooling source on a slab floor.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/in-row-cooling.jpg">
</p>
<p>The in-row cooling unit draws warm exhaust air directly from the hot aisle, cools it and distributes it to the cold aisle. This ensures that inlet temperatures are steady for precise operation. Coupling the air conditioning with the heat source produces an efficient direct return air path; this is called <em>close coupled cooling</em>, which also lowers the fan energy required. In-row cooling also prevents the mixing of hot and cold air, thus increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>It&apos;s possible to give more cooling to a single rack, modulating the air needed. In front of the rack there are temperature and humidity sensors (humidity should be avoided because can conduct electricity).<br>
There are systems collecting data from the sensors and adjusting the fans. The racks are covered to separate cool air and hot air. It&apos;s also possible to optimize the datacenter cooling according to the temperature changes of the region where the datacenter is. It is also possible to apply &quot;static analysis&quot; to the datacenter location, in order to optimize resource consumption according to temperature changes. Programs are available in order to simulate airflows in datacenter in order to optimize the fans.</p>
<p>Usually every 2 racks (each 70 cm) there should be a cooling row (30 cm).</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="liquid-cooling">Liquid cooling</h4>

<p>Having water in a data center is a risky business (even if there are different ways to handle a fire). Make the water flow onto the CPUs lowers the temperature for ~40%. One way of chilling the water could be pushing it down to the ground. Water Distribution System, like the Power Distribution System.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="other-ideas">Other ideas</h4>

<p>A lot of research has been lately invested towards oil cooling computers (particularly in the contest of High Performance Computing). Both this approach and liquid cooling provide water circuits that flow straight over the CPU in order to maximize the effectiveness of the cooling.<br>
A typical approach to cool the air is to place chillers outside the building, or by trying geocooling, which revolves around using the cold air in depth. The main idea is to make a deep hole in the ground, and make the cables pass through it.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="current">Current</h2>

<p>A 32KW datacenter is small (also if it consumes the same amount of current of 10 apartments).</p>
<p><em>Direct Current Transformers</em> from AC to DC. Direct current is distributed inside the datacenter even if is more dangerous than Alternating current.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{Watt}%20=%20\cos\phi\cdot%20V\cdot%20A">
</p>
<p>Where <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ccos%5Cphi" alt="cosfi"> gives the efficiency of the power supply and generally it changes according to the amount of current needed (idle vs under pressure). <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ccos%5Cphi" alt="cosfi"> is the heat dissemination happening from conversion of AC into DC current, and it is a number &lt;= 1.<br>
For example an idle server with 2 CPUs (14 cores each) consumes 140 Watts.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="power-distribution">Power Distribution</h3>

<p>The Industrial current has 380 Volts in 3 phases. The amount of current allowed in a data center are the Ampere on the <em>PDU</em> (Power Distribution Unit).</p>
<p>There are one or more lines (for reliability and fault tolerance reasons) coming from different generators to the datacenter (i.e. each line 80 KW , 200 A more or less. Can use it for 6 racks 32A / rack. Maybe I will not use the whole 32 A so I can put more racks).</p>
<p>The lines are attached to an <em>UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply/Source)</em>. It is a rack or half a rack with batteries (not enough to keep-on the servers) that in some cases can power the DC for ~20 minutes. There are a <em>Control Panel</em> and a <em>Generator</em>. When the power lines fail the UPS is active between their failure and the starting of the generator.  The energy that arrives to the UPS should be divided among the servers and the switches.</p>
<p>The UPS is attached to the <em>PDU</em> (Power Distribution Unit) which is linked to the <em>server PDU</em> with a pair of lines for redundancy. In the server there are the power plugs in a row that can monitored via a web server running on the rack PDU.</p>
<p>Example of rack PDU: 2 banks, 12 plugs each, 16 A each bank, 15 KW per rack, 42 servers per rack.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="power-factor">Power factor</h4>

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
<p>Alternating current (AC) supplies our buildings and equipment. AC is more efficient for power companies to deliver, but when it hits the equipment&apos;s transformers, it exhibits a characteristic known as reactance.</p>
<p>Reactance reduces the useful power (watts) available from the apparent power (volt-amperes). The ratio of these two numbers is called the power factor (PF). Therefore, the actual power formula for AC circuits is watts = volts x amps x power factor. Unfortunately, the PF is rarely stated for most equipment, but it is always a number of 1.0 or less, and about the only thing with a 1.0 PF is a light bulb.</p>
<p>For years, large UPS systems were designed based on a PF of 0.8, which meant that a 100 kVA UPS would only support 80 kW of real power load.</p>
<p>The majority of large, commercial UPS systems are now designed with a PF of 0.9. This recognizes that most of today&apos;s computing technology presents a PF of between 0.95 and 0.98 to the UPS. Some UPS systems are even designed with PFs of 1.0, which means the kVA and kW ratings are identical (100 kVA = 100 kW). However, since the IT load never presents a 1.0 PF, for these UPS systems, the actual load limit will be the kVA rating.</p>
<p>Use the hardware manufacturers&apos; online configurations if possible. As a last resort, use the server&apos;s power supply rating -- a server with a 300-Watt power supply can never draw 800 Watts. Size the power systems based on real demand loads.</p>
<p>Dual-corded equipment adds redundancy to IT hardware, and the lines share power load. If a dual-corded server has two 300-Watt power supplies, it can still draw no more than 300 Watts in your power design, because each power supply has to be able to handle the server&apos;s full load (not including power supply efficiency calculations).</p>
<p>The other way to estimate total server power consumption is to use industry norms. Unless you&apos;re hosting high performance computing, you can probably figure groupings in three levels of density: Low density cabinets run 3.5 to 5 kW; medium density run 5 to 10 kW; high density run 10 to 15 kW. The amount of each rack type to allocate depends on your operation. Generally, data centers operate with about 50% low density cabinets, 35% medium and 15% high density.</p>
<p>If your projected average is more than 1.5 times your existing average, take a closer look at the numbers. This result is fine if you expect a significant density increase, due to new business requirements or increased virtualization onto blade servers. But if there&apos;s no apparent reason for such a density growth, re-examine your assumptions.</p>
</details>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="pue-power-usage-effectiveness">PUE: Power Usage Effectiveness</h3>

<p>PUE is a ratio that describes how efficiently a computer data center uses energy; specifically, how much energy is used by the computing equipment (in contrast to cooling and other overhead).</p>
<p>PUE is the ratio of total amount of energy used by a computer data center facility  to the energy delivered to computing equipment. PUE is the inverse of data center infrastructure efficiency (DCIE).</p>
<p>As example, consider that the PUE of the university&apos;s datacenter during 2018 is less 1.2, while the average italian data center&apos;s PUE are around 2-2.5.</p>
<p>If the PUE is equal to 2 means that for each Watt used for computing, 1 Watt is used for cooling.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<h1 class="mume-header" id="fabric">Fabric</h1>

<p>The fabric is the interconnection between nodes inside a datacenter. We can think this level as a bunch of switch and wires.</p>
<p>We refer to North-South traffic indicating the traffic outgoing and incoming to the datacenter (internet), while we refer to East-West as the internal traffic between servers.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="ethernet">Ethernet</h2>

<p>The connection can be performed with various technologies, the most famous is <strong>Ethernet</strong>, commonly used in Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN). Ethernet use twisted pair and optic fiber links. Ethernet as some famous features such as 48-bit MAC address and Ethernet frame format that influenced other networking protocols.</p>
<p><strong>MTU</strong> (Maximum Transfer Unit) up to 9 KB with the so called <strong>Jumbo Frames</strong>.<br>
On top of ethernet there are TCP/IP protocols (this is a standard), they introduce about 70-100 micro sec of latency.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="infiniband">Infiniband</h2>

<p>Even if Ethernet is so famous, there are other standard to communicate. <strong>InfiniBand (IB)</strong> is another standard used in high-performance computing (HPC) that features very high throughput and very low latency (about 2 microseconds). InfiniBand is a protocol and a physical infrastructure and it can send up to 2GB messages with 16 priorities level.<br>
The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4391">RFC 4391</a> specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting IPv4/IPv6 and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets over InfiniBand (IB).</p>
<p>InfiniBand transmits data in packets up to 4KB. A massage can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a remote direct memory access read from or write to a remote node (<a href="#rdma-remote-direct-memory-access"><strong>RDMA</strong></a>)</li>
<li>a channel send or receive</li>
<li>a transaction-based operation (that can be reversed)</li>
<li>a multicast transmission</li>
<li>an atomic operation</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>no retransmissions</li>
<li>QoS, traffic preserved, reliable</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="rdma-remote-direct-memory-access">RDMA: Remote Direct Memory Access</h2>

<p>Access, a direct memory access (really!) from one computer into that of another without involving either one&apos;s OS, this permits high-throughput, low-latency networking performing.</p>
<p>RDMA supports zero-copy networking by enabling the network adapter to transfer data directly to or from application memory, eliminating the need to copy data between application memory and the data buffers in the operating system, and by bypassing TCP/IP. Such transfers require no work to be done by CPUs, caches, or context switches, and transfers continue in parallel with other system operations. When an application performs an RDMA Read or Write request, the application data is delivered directly to the network, reducing latency and enabling fast message transfer. The main use case is distributed storage.</p>
<p align="center">

<h2 class="mume-header" id="omni-path">Omni-Path</h2>

<p>Moreover, another communication architecture that exist and is interested to see is Omni-Path. This architecture is owned by Intel and performs high-performance communication(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni-Path">Ompni-Path Wikipedia</a>).<br>
The interest of this architecture is that Intel plans to develop technology based on that will serve as the on-ramp to exascale computing (a computing system capable of the least one exaFLOPS).</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="connectors-plugs">Connectors &amp; plugs</h2>

<p>Now we try to analyse the problem from the connector point of view. The fastest wire technology available is the optic fiber. It can be divided into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>mono-modal (1250 nm): expensive, lower loss, covers distances up to 60KM. Used in WAN/MAN</li>
<li>multi-modal (850 nm): cheap, covers distances up to 2KM. Used in datacenters</li>
</ul>
<p>They also have different transceiver. There are two kind of connectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>LC: ok for datacenters</li>
<li>SC: usually used in metropolitan areas because it has a better signal propagation</li>
</ul>
<p>There can be a cable with a LC in one side and a SC on the other side.</p>
<p>Of course, a wire is a wire, and we need something to connect it to somewhere (transceiver):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPF</strong> (Small form-factor pluggable), a compact, hot-pluggable optical module transceiver
<ul>
<li>1 Gbps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SFP+</strong>, can be combined with some other SFP+
<ul>
<li>10 Gbps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>QSFP</strong> (Quad SPF)
<ul>
<li>4x10 Gbps (if combined with SPF+)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SFP28</strong>, where the number 28 is the number of pins
<ul>
<li>25 GBps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>QSFP28</strong> (Quad SPF28)
<ul>
<li>4x25 Gbps (if combined with SFP28)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RJ45</strong>, in datacenters there are almost no installations of it
<ul>
<li>10/100 Mbps, 1/2.5/5 Gbps.</li>
<li>Different cables have categories (cat4, cat5, cat6)
<ul>
<li>2.5/5 Gbps are new standards working on cat5 and cat6 cables respectively, in order to deliver more bandwidth to the WiFi access point.</li>

<h2 class="mume-header" id="software-defined-approach">Software Defined Approach</h2>

<p>The Software Defined Approach, where approach is Networking (<a href="#sdn-software-defined-networking"><strong>SDN</strong></a>) or Storage (<a href="#sds---software-defined-storage"><strong>SDS</strong></a>), is a novel approach to cloud computing.</p>
<p>Software-defined approach abstracts all the infrastructure components (compute, storage, and network), and pools them into aggregated capacity. It separates the control or management functions from the underlying components to the external software, which takes over the control operations to manage the multi-vendor infrastructure components centrally.<br>
This decoupling enable to centralize all data provisioning and management tasks through software, external to the infrastructure components.<br>
The software runs on a centralized compute system or a standalone device, called the software-defined controller.</p>
<p>Benefits of software-defined approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves business agility: minimizes resource provisioning time to get new services up and running</li>
<li>Provides cost efficiency: enables to effectively use the existing infrastructure and low-cost commodity hardware to lower CAPEX</li>
<li>Enables to achieve scale-out architecture</li>
<li>Provides a central point of access to all management functions</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="sdn-software-defined-networking">SDN: Software Defined Networking</h3>

<p>SDN is an architecture purposing to be dynamic, manageablea and cost-effective (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking#Concept">SDN Wikipedia</a>). This type of software create a virtual network to manage the network with more simplicity.</p>
<p>The main concept are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network control is directly programmable (also from remote)</li>
<li>The infrastructure is agile, since it can be dynamically adjustable</li>
<li>It is programmatically configured and is managed by a software-based SDN controller</li>
<li>It is Open Standard-based and Vendor-neutral</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <strong>flow table</strong> in the switches that remembers the connection. The routing policies are adopted according to this table.<br>
Deep packet inspection made by a level 7 firewall. The firewall validates the flow and if it&apos;s aware that the flow needs bandwidth, the firewall allows it to bypass the redirection (of the firewall).</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="software-defined-data-center">Software-defined data center</h3>

<p>Software-defined data center is a sort of upgrade of the previous term and indicate a series of virtualization concepts such as abstraction, pooling and automation to all data center resources and services to achieve IT as a service.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="hyper-convergence">Hyper-convergence</h3>

<p>So we virtualize the networking, the storage, the data center... and the cloud! Some tools, as <a href="https://www.nutanix.com/hyperconverged-infrastructure/">Nutanix</a> build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure">hyper-converged infrastructure HCI</a> technology.</p>
<p>Hyper-converged infrastructure combines common datacenter hardware using locally attached storage resources with intelligent software to create flexible building blocks that replace legacy infrastructure consisting of separate servers, storage networks, and storage arrays.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<p>A way of cabling allowing multiple computers to communicate. It&apos;s not necessary a graph,but for the reliability purpose it often realized as a set of connected  nodes. At least 10% of nodes should be connected in order to guarantee a sufficient reliability (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">Small World Theory</a>).</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="spanning-tree-protocol-stp">Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</h4>

<p>First of all it is necessary to understand the loop problem. A loop is a cycle of the links between various nodes which creates a &quot;DDoS-like&quot; situation by flooding the network.<br>
The spanning Tree Protocol is a network protocol that builds a logical loop-free topology for Ethernet networks. It builds a spanning tree from the existing topology graph, and disabilitates the remaining links. <!-- The spanning tree is built using some Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) frames. --> In 2001 the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) that provides significantly faster spanning tree convergence after a topology change.</p>
<p>Nowadays this protocol is used only in campus and not in datacenters, due to its hight latency of convergence (up to 10-15 seconds to activate a backup line).</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="network-chassis">Network Chassis</h4>

<p>The Network Chassis is a sort of big  modular and resilient switch. At the bottom it has a pair of power plugs and then it&apos;s made of modular <strong>line cards</strong> (with some kind of ports) and a pair of <strong>RPM</strong> Routing Processing Modules to ensure that the line cards work. The chassis can be over provisioned to resist to aging but it has a limit.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="300" src="./assets/cisco-chassis.png">
</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>resilient</li>
<li>1 CLI per switch</li>
<li>expandible</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>expensive</li>
<li>not entirely future proof (today some switches may need up to 1KW power supply, while years ago they needed only 200 W)</li>
<li>aging problem</li>
</ul>
<p>The chassis is connected with the rack&apos;s <strong>tor</strong> and <strong>bor</strong> (top/bottom of rack) switches via a double link.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="stacking">Stacking</h4>

<p>Some network switches have the ability to be connected to other switches and operate together as a single unit. These configurations are called stacks, and are useful for quickly increasing the capacity of a network.</p>
<p>It&apos;s cheaper than the chassis but there is less redundancy and it is not upgradable without connectivity.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="three-tier-design">Three-tier design</h3>

<p>This architecture is simple architecture where each component has a redundant unit to replace it in case of failure.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="spine-and-leaf-architecture">Spine and leaf Architecture</h3>

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="./assets/spine-leaf-vs-3-tier.png">
  <img width="800" src="./assets/spine-and-leaves.jpg">
</p>
<p><strong>Every leaf switch is connected to every spine</strong>. Therefore, the <strong>number of connections used for uplinks</strong> from each leaf determines <strong>the number of spine switches we can have</strong> (4 ports here for four spine switches). And <strong>the number of ports on each spine</strong> switch determines <strong>the number of leaf switches we can have</strong> (20 leaf switches here).</p>
<p>With the increased focus on east-west data transfer the three-tier design architecture is being replaced with Spine-Leaf design. The switches are divided into 2 groups, the leaf switches and spine switches. Every leaf switch in a leaf-spine architecture connects to every switch in the network fabric.<br>
In that topology the <strong>Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is used</strong>. It provides a method to control the bundling of several physical ports together to form a single logical channel. The first two ports of every switch are reserved to create a link with a twin switch (a loop is created, but the OS is aware of that and it avoids it). Next ports are the ones used to create links with leaf nodes. The bandwidth is aggregated (i.e. 2*25 Gbps): a single flow will only use a single link, but you can use the full channel bandwidth in aggregate.</p>
<p>Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed form factor (non modular switches)</li>
<li>active-active redundancy</li>
<li>loop aware topology (no links disabled).</li>
<li>interconnect using standard cables (decide how many links use to interconnect spines with leaves and how many others link to racks).</li>
</ul>
<p>With this architecture it&apos;s possible to turn off one switch, upgrade it and reboot it without compromising the network. Half of the bandwidth is lost in the process, but the twin switch keeps the connection alive.</p>
<p>A typical configuration of the ports and bandwidth of the leaves is:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 going upwards and 2/3 going downwards</li>
<li>48 ports 10 Gbps each (downward - from leaves to racks)
<ul>
<li>plus 6 ports 40 Gbps each (upward - from leaves to spines)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>or 48 ports 25 each (downward)

<p>Just a small remark: with spine and leaf we introduce <strong>more hops</strong>, so more latency, than the chassis approach. The solution for this problem is using as a base of the spine a <strong>huge switch (256 ports)</strong> which actually acts as a chassis, in order to reduce the number of hops and latency.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="oversubscription">Oversubscription</h3>

<p>Another factor to keep in mind when designing your fabric is the <strong>oversubscription ratio</strong>. In a leaf-spine design, this oversubscription is measured as the <strong>ratio of downlink ports</strong> (to servers/storage) <strong>to uplink ports</strong> (to spine switches). If you have 20 servers each connected with 10Gbps links and 4 10Gbps uplinks to your spine switches, you have a 5:1 oversubscription ratio (200Gbps/40Gbps). Significant increases in the use of multi-core CPUs, server virtualization, flash storage, Big Data and cloud computing have driven the requirement for modern networks to have lower oversubscription. Current <strong>modern network designs</strong> have oversubscription ratios of <strong>3:1</strong> or less.</p>
<p>Is it possible to achieve a degree of oversubscription equal to 1?<br>
Yes, and it is possible by just linking half the ports upwards and half down. This is the basis of the full fat tree.</p>

Start think about real world. We have some server with 1 Gbps (not so high speed, just think that is the speed you can reach with your laptop attaching a cable that is in classroom in the university). We have to connect this servers to each other, using switches (each of them has 48 ports). We have a lots of servers... The computation is done.
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/speed-required.png">
</p>
<p>As we see we need a lots of bandwidth to manage a lots of service and even if the north-south traffic (the traffic that goes outside from our datacenter) can be relatively small (the university connection exits on the world with 40 Gbps), the east-west traffic (the traffic inside the datacenter) can reach a very huge number of Gbps. <a href="https://www.arubacloud.com/infrastructures/italy-dc-it1.aspx">Aruba datacenter</a> (called IT1) with another Aruba datacenter (IT2) reach a bandwidth of 82 Gbps of Internet connection.</p>
</details>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="full-fat-tree">Full Fat Tree</h3>

<p>In this network topology, the link that are nearer the top of the hierarchy are &quot;fatter&quot; (thicker) than the link further down the hierarchy. <strong>Used only in high performance computing</strong> where performances have priority over budgets.</p>
<p>The full fat tree <strong>resolves the problem of over-subscription</strong>. Adopting the spine and leaf there is the risk that the links closer to the spines can&apos;t sustain the traffic coming from all the links going from the servers to the leaves. The full fat tree is a way to build a tree so that the capacity is never less than the incoming traffic. It&apos;s <strong>quite expensive</strong> and because of this reason some over subscription can be accepted.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/full-fat-tree-network.png">
</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="vlan">VLAN</h3>

<p>Now, the problem is that every switch can be connected to each other and so there is no more LANs separation in the datacenter, every packet can go wherever it wants and some problems may appear. VLANs solve this problem partitioning a broadcast domain and creating isolated computer networks.</p>
<p>A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a virtual network consisting of virtual and/or physical switches, which <strong>divides a LAN into smaller logical segments</strong>. A VLAN groups the nodes with a common set of functional requirements, independent of the physical location of the nodes. In a multi-tenant cloud environment, the provider typically creates and assigns a <strong>separate VLAN to each consumer</strong>. This provides a private network and IP address space to a consumer, and ensures isolation from the network traffic of other consumers.</p>
<p>It works by applying <strong>tags</strong> (from 1 to 4094) to network packets (in Ethernet frame) and handling these tags in the networking systems.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/vlan.png">
</p>
<p>A <strong>switch can be configured to accept some tags</strong> on some ports and some other tags on some other ports.</p>
<p>VLAN are useful to manage the <strong>access control</strong> to some resources (and avoid to access to some subnetwork from other subnetwork). Different VLANs are usually used for different purposes.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="switch-anatomy">Switch Anatomy</h3>

<p>A switch is an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). It can be proprietary architecture or non-proprietary. Layer 2 switches receive packets and implements the equivalent of a bus: store and forward (there is a special address allowing broadcast). At layer 3 there is no loop problem, as in layer 2, because of the Internet Table.</p>
<p>Datacenter&apos;s switches are usually <strong>non-blocking</strong>. It basically means that this switches have the forwarding capacity that supports concurrently <strong>all ports at full capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>Now some standard are trying to impose a common structure to the network elements (switch included) to facilitate the creation of standard orchestration and automation tools.</p>
<p>The internal is made of a <strong>control plane</strong> which is configurable and a <strong>data plane</strong> where there are the ports and where the actual switching is made. The control plane evolved during the years, now they run an OS and Intel CPU&apos;s. Through a CLI Command Line Interface it&apos;s possible to configure the control plane. Some examples of command are:</p>
<ul>
<li>show running config</li>
<li>show interfaces status</li>
<li>show vlan</li>
<li>config (to enter in config mode)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some protocols in the switch (bold ones are important):</p>
<ul>
<li>PING to test connectivity.</li>
<li>LLDP Local Link Discovery Protocol ( a way to explore the graph).</li>
<li><strong>STP</strong> Spanning Tree Protocol (to avoid loops).</li>

<li><strong>LACP</strong>  Link Aggregation Control Protocol (use two wires as they are one).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ONIE</strong> (Open Networking Installed Environment) boot loader<br>
The switch has a firmware and two slots for the OS images. When updating in the first slot we store the old OS image, in the second slot the new one.</p>

The data plane is connected to a DC&apos;s VM which acts as a control plane.</p>

<li>RAID-1: mirroring, write on both the drives one is the copy of the other.</li>
<li>RAID-5: block-level striping with distributed parity. It&apos;s xor based: the first bit goes in the first disk, the second bit in the second one and their xor in the third.

<p>It&apos;s a protocol on the PCI-express bus and it&apos;s totally <strong>controller-less</strong>. From the software side it&apos;s simpler in this way to talk with the disk because the driver is directly attached to the PCI, there is no controller and minor latency.</p>
<p>A bus is a component where I can attach different devices. It has a clock and some lanes (16 in PCI,  ~15 GBps because each lane is slightly less then 1 GB). <strong>Four drives are enough to exhaust a full PCI v3 bus</strong>.

<h2 class="mume-header" id="network-area-storage-nas">Network Area Storage (NAS)</h2>

<p>NAS is a <strong>file-level</strong> computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients. NAS systems are networked appliances which contain one or more storage drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID. They typically provide access to files using network file sharing protocols such as <strong>NFS</strong>, <strong>SMB/CIFS</strong>, or AFP over a optical fiber.</p>
<p>Basically <strong>the whole storage is exposed as a file system</strong>. When using a network file system protocol, you are using a NAS.</p>
<p>Storage system architectures are based on data access methods whose common variants are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>block-based (SAN)</strong>: a block-based storage system enables the creation and assignment of storage volumes to compute systems. The compute OS (or hypervisor) discovers these <strong>storage volumes as local drives</strong>. A file system can be created on these storage volumes, for example NTFS in a Windows environment, which can then be formatted and used by applications.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/block-based-storage-access.png" width="600">
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>file-based</strong>: a file-based storage system, also known as Network-Attached Storage (NAS), is a dedicated, high-performance file server having either integrated storage or connected to external storage. NAS enables clients to share files over an IP network. NAS supports <strong>NFS</strong> and <strong>CIFS</strong> protocols to give both UNIX and Windows clients the ability to share the same files using appropriate access and locking mechanisms. NAS systems have integrated hardware and software components, including a processor, memory, NICs, ports to connect and manage physical disk resources, an OS optimized for file serving, and file sharing protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/file-based-storage-access.png" width="600">
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>object-based</strong>: object-based storage is a way to <strong>store file data in the form of objects based on the content and other attributes</strong> of the data rather than the name and location of the file. An object contains user data, related metadata (size, date, ownership, etc.), and user defined attributes of data (retention, access pattern, and other business-relevant attributes). The additional <strong>metadata or attributes enable optimized search</strong>, retention and deletion of objects. The object-based storage system uses a flat, non-hierarchical address space to store data, providing the flexibility to scale massively. Cloud service providers leverage object-based storage systems to offer Storage as a Service because of its inherent security, scalability, and automated data management capabilities. Object-based storage systems support web service access via REST and SOAP. Eg. <strong>AWS S3</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/object-based-storage-access.png" width="600">
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>unified</strong>: unified storage or multi-protocol storage has emerged as a solution that consolidates block, file, and object-based access within one storage platform. It <strong>supports multiple protocols</strong> such as CIFS, NFS, iSCSI, FC, FCoE, REST, and SOAP for data access</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/unified-storage-access.png" width="600">
</p>
<p><strong>iSCASI</strong>: Internet Small Computer Systems Interface, an IP-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. It provides <strong>block-level access to storage</strong> devices by carrying SCSI commands over a TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="storage-area-network-san">Storage Area Network (SAN)</h2>

<p>A network of compute systems and storage systems is called a Storage Area Network (SAN). A SAN enables the compute systems to <strong>access and share storage systems</strong>. Sharing improves the utilization of the storage systems. Using a SAN facilitates centralizing storage management, which in turn simplifies and potentially standardizes the management effort.<br>
<strong>SANs are classified based on protocols they support</strong>. Common SAN deployments types are Fibre Channel SAN (FC SAN), Internet Protocol SAN (IP SAN), and Fibre Channel over Ethernet SAN (FCoE SAN), ATA over Ethernet (AoE) adn HyperSCSI. It can be implemented as some controllers attached to some JBoDS (Just a Bunch of Disks).</p>
<p>While NAS provides both storage and a file system, <strong>SAN provides only block-based storage</strong> and leaves file system concerns on the &quot;client&quot; side.</p>
<p>The SAN <strong>can be divided in different Logical Unit Numbers</strong> (<strong>LUNs</strong>). The LUN abstracts the identity and internal functions of storage systems and <strong>appear as physical storage</strong> to the compute system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage capacity of a <strong>LUN can be dynamically expanded</strong> or reduced (<strong>virtual storage provisioning:</strong> It enables to present a LUN to an application with more capacity than is physically allocated to it on the storage system.)</li>
<li>LUN can be created from
<ul>
<li>RAID set (traditional approach): suited for applications that require <strong>predictable performance</strong></li>
<li>Storage pool: LUNs can be <strong>created from the storage pool</strong> that comprises a set of physical drives that provide the actual physical storage used by the volumes. Appropriate for applications that can tolerate performance variations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the drive is seen as physically attached to the machine, and a block transmission protocol is adopted that means that you are using a SAN. The optical fiber has become the bottleneck (just four drives to saturate a link).</p>
<p>With SAN the server has the impression that the LUN is attached directly to him, locally; with NAS there isn&apos;t this kind of abstraction.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="hci-hyperconvergent-systems">HCI - Hyperconvergent Systems</h2>

<ul>
<li>Nutanix: is the current leader of this technology</li>
<li>Ceph: is a different architecture/approach</li>
<li>vSAN</li>
<li>SSD - Storage Spaces Direct</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of software is <strong>expensive</strong> (Nutanix HCI is fully software defined so you <strong>do not depend on the vendors hardware</strong>).</p>
<p>The main idea is not to design three different systems (compute, networking, storage) and then connect them, but it&apos;s better to have a bit of them in each server I deploy. &quot;<strong>Adding servers adds capacity</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/nutanix-hci.png" width="600">
</p>
<p>The software works with the cooperations of different controller (VMs) in each node (server). <strong>The controller (VM) implements the storage abstraction through the node and it implements also the logical moving of data</strong>. Every <strong>write keeps a copy on the local server storage</strong> exploiting the PCI bus and avoiding the network cap; a copy of the data is given to the controller of another node. The <strong>read is performed locally</strong> gaining high performances. The VM is aware that there are two copies of the data so it can exploit this fact. <strong>Once a drive fails its copy is used to make another copy</strong> of the data. The write operation is a little bit slower since I need to wait for the &apos;ack&apos; of the controller in order to keep replicas of the written data on other nodes (sync replica).</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="sds-software-defined-storage">SDS - Software Defined Storage</h2>

<p>Software-defined Storage is a term for computer data storage software for <strong>policy-based provisioning and management of data storage</strong> independent of the underlying hardware. This type of software includes a storage virtualization to separate storage hardware from the software that manages it.<br>
It&apos;s used to build a <strong>distributed system that provides storage services</strong>. Uses <strong>object-based storage architecture</strong> (objectID, metadata, binary data).</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="non-raid-drive-architectures">Non-RAID drive architectures</h2>

<p>Also other architectures exist and are used when RAID is too expensive or not required.</p>
<ul>
<li>JBOD (&quot;just a bunch of disks&quot;): multiple hard disk drives operated as individual independent hard disk drives</li>
<li>SPAN: A method of combining free space on multiple hard disk drives from &quot;JBoD&quot; to create a spanned volume</li>
<li>DAS (Direct-attached storage): a digital storage directly attached to the computer accessing it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="some-consideration-about-flash-drives">Some consideration about Flash Drives</h2>

<p>The <strong>bottleneck</strong> in new drives is the <strong>connector</strong>. The SATA connector is too slow to use SSD at the maximum speed. Some results can be see <a href="http://www.itc.unipi.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ITC-TR-01-16.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The solution? Delete the connector and attach it to PCIe. So new Specification is used, the NVMe, an open logical device interface specification for accessing non-volatile storage media attached via a PCI Express bus.</p>

<p>Racks are divided in Units: 1 U is the minimal size you can allocate on a rack. Generally 2 meters rack has 42 Units.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="types-of-compute-systems">Types of compute systems</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rack-mounted</strong>: a rack-mounted compute system is a compute system designed to be <strong>fixed on a frame called a &#x201C;rack&#x201D;</strong>. A rack is a standardized enclosure containing multiple mounting slots, each of which holds a server. A single rack <strong>contains multiple servers stacked vertically</strong>, thereby <strong>simplifying network cabling</strong>, consolidating network equipment, and reducing floor space use. Each rack server has its own power supply and cooling unit. A &#x201C;rack unit&#x201D; (denoted by U or RU) is a unit of measure of the height of a server designed to be mounted on a rack. One rack unit is 1.75 inches (~4.5cm). A rack server is typically 19 inches (~50cm) in width and 1.75 inches (~45cm) in height. This is called a <strong>1U rack</strong> server. Other common sizes of rack servers are 2U and 4U. Some common rack cabinet sizes are 27U, 37U, and 42U. Typically, a console with a video screen, keyboard, and mouse is mounted on a rack to enable administrators to <strong>manage the servers in the rack</strong>. Some concerns with rack servers are that they are cumbersome to work with, and they generate a lot of heat because of which more cooling is required, which in turn increases power costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blade</strong>: a blade compute system, also known as a blade server, <strong>contains only core processing components</strong>, such as processor(s), memory, integrated network controllers, storage drive, and essential I/O cards and ports. Each blade server is a <strong>self-contained compute system</strong> and is typically dedicated to a single application. A blade server is housed in a slot <strong>inside a chassis</strong>, which holds multiple blades and provides <strong>integrated power supply</strong>, <strong>cooling</strong>, <strong>networking</strong>, and <strong>management</strong> functions. The blade enclosure enables interconnection of the blades through a high speed bus and also provides connectivity to external storage systems. The modular design of blade servers makes them smaller, which <strong>minimizes floor space</strong> requirements, <strong>increases</strong> compute <strong>system density and scalability</strong>, and provides <strong>better energy efficiency</strong> as compared to tower and rack servers.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Hyper-threading makes a single processor core appear as two logical processor cores, allowing the hyper-threading enabled operating system (or hypervisor) to schedule two threads simultaneously to avoid idle time on processor. However, the two threads cannot be executed at the same time because the two logical cores share the resources of a single physical core. When core resources are not in use by the current thread, especially when the processor is stalled (for example due to data dependency), resources of the core are used to execute the next scheduled thread.<br>
In this case emerges a problem of memory condivision, and the solutions are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>One cache per core</li>
<li>One cache per couple of cores</li>
<li>A shared RAM between some cores (Multi channel D-RAM:  more bandwidth than DDR)</li>
</ul>

<p>Is a business model. The cloud is someone else&apos;s computer that you can use (paying) to execute your application with more reliable feature than your laptop (i.e. paying for doing tests on your app using the cloud infrastructure because you need more resources). The interaction to obtain the cloud resources should be &quot;self service&quot; for as much as possible.<br>
When you program for the cloud you dont know where your process will be executed or where you data will be stored.</p>
<p>Cloud is a collection of <strong>network-accessible</strong> IT resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>consists of <strong>shared pools of hardware and software resources</strong> deployed in data centers</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main concept of cloud computing is the one of pooling, which means that a set of <strong>heterogeneous resources</strong> can be viewed as a whole big resource in order to provide reassignment capability and location independence (which means that the client cannot control where his data are, except for maybe the geographical area). Another important concept is the one of resource measurement. The cloud computing business model revolves around pricing and resource consumption, so the system must be able to monitor it.</p>
<p>Cloud computing <strong>benefits</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agility</li>
<li>Reduction of IT cost (CAPEX to OPEX)</li>
<li>High Availability and fault tolerance</li>
<li>Business Continuity</li>
<li>Rapid development and testing</li>
<li>No infrastructure management</li>

<p><strong>Rapid Elasticity</strong>: consumers can adapt to variation in workloads and mantain required performance levels. This permits also to reduce costs avoiding the overprovisining.</p>
<p><strong>High Avaialability</strong>: the cloud provide high avaialabity. This feature can be achived with redundancy of resources to avoid system failure. Some Load Balancer is used to balance the request between all the resources to avoid failure due the resources saturation on some machine.</p>
<p>The cloud infrastrucure can be <strong>public</strong>, if it is provisioned for open use by the general public; or <strong>private</strong>, if is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers.</p>

<h3 class="mume-header" id="cross-functional-layers">Cross functional layers</h3>

<p>In the cloud computing reference model there are some sylos of cross layer functionalities, they mainly revolve around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Continuity: In data center failure is the norm, so I have to consider business continuity. It is reactive (disaster recovery) and proactive (risk assessment, backup, replicas...).</li>
<li>Security: policies, standard procedures, firewalls, antivirus, intrusion detection/prevention.</li>
<li>Service Management: Portfolio (SLA, roadmap, customer support...) and operation (monitoring, provisioning, compliance...)</li>

<h3 class="mume-header" id="phyisical-layer">Phyisical Layer</h3>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/physical-layer.png" width="600">
</p>
<p>The physical layer comprises compute, storage, and network resources, which are the fundamental physical computing resources that make up a cloud infrastructure. It executes requests generated by virtualization and control layer and specifies entities that operate at this layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>storage and its access method (file-based, block-based, object-based or unified)</li>
<li>network</li>
<li>compute systems</li>
<li>other resources</li>

<p>Benefits of virtualization:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimize utilization of IT resources</li>

<p>This allows a <strong>multi tenant environment</strong> since I can run multiple organizations VMs on the same server.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="vm-network-components">VM Network components</h4>

<p>VM networks comprise virtual switches, virtual NICs, and uplink NICs that are created on a physical compute system running a hypervisor.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>vSwitch</strong>: a virtual switch is a <strong>logical OSI Layer 2 Ethernet switch</strong> created within a compute system. A virtual switch is either internal or external. An internal virtual switch connects only the VMs on a compute system. It has no connection to any physical NIC and cannot forward traffic to a physical network. An external virtual switch connects the VMs on a compute system to each other and also to one or more physical NICs. A physical NIC already connected to a virtual switch cannot be attached to any other virtual switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>vNIC</strong>: A virtual NIC <strong>connects a VM to a virtual switch</strong> and functions similar to a physical NIC. Virtual NICs send and receive VM traffic to and from the VM network. A VM can have one or more virtual NICs. Each virtual NIC has unique MAC and IP addresses and uses the Ethernet protocol exactly as a physical NIC does. The hypervisor generates the MAC addresses and allocates them to virtual NICs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplink NIC</strong>: an uplink NIC is a physical NIC connected to the uplink port of a virtual switch and functions as an <strong>Inter-Switch Link</strong> between the virtual switch and a physical Ethernet switch. It is called uplink because it only provides a physical interface to connect a compute system to the network and <strong>is not addressable from the network</strong>. Uplink NICs are <strong>neither assigned an IP address nor are their built-in MAC addresses</strong> available to any compute system in the network. It simply forwards the VM traffic between the VM network and the external physical network without modification.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="vm-components">VM components</h4>

<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is responsible for running multiple VMs. Since I want to execute x86 ISA over an x86 server I don&apos;t need to translate the code. An hypervisor <strong>permits to overbook physical resources</strong> to allocate more resources than exist and it also create also a <strong>virtual switch to distribute the networking</strong> over all VMs.</p>
<p>Hypervisors types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bare-metal</strong>: directly installed on the hardware. It has <strong>direct access to the hardware</strong> resources of the compute system. Therefore, it is more efficient than a hosted hypervisor. However, this type of hypervisor may have limited device drivers built-in. Therefore, hardware certified by the hypervisor vendor is usually required to run bare-metal hypervisors. A bare-metal hypervisor is designed for enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Hosted</strong>: installed as an application on an operating system. In this approach, the hypervisor <strong>does not have direct access to the hardware</strong> and all requests must pass through the operating system running on the physical compute system.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="types-of-virtualization">Types of virtualization</h4>

<p>Types of virtualization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>paravirtualization</strong> the virtual kernel cooperates with the hosting OS.
<ul>
<li>the CPU is aware of the virtualization, it distinguishes the interrupts generated by the vOS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>driver integration</strong> you don&apos;t have to emlulate all the drivers but you can ask the underlying OS for this service.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="virtual-machine-vm">Virtual Machine (VM)</h4>

<p>Each <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> is a <strong>set of discrete configuration files</strong> where there are the values aswering the questions: how much memory, how much disk, where is the disk file, how many CPU&apos;s cores. An example of those files are:</p>
<ul>
<li>configuration file: stores information, such as VM name, BIOS information, guest OS type, memory size</li>
<li>virtual disk file: stores the contents of the VM&apos;s disk drive</li>
<li>memory state file: stores the memory contents of a VM in a suspended state</li>
<li>snapshot file: stores the VM settings and virtual disk of a VM</li>
</ul>
<p>The disk is virtualized usign a file, while for the Network there is a VNIC (Network Interface Card) connected to a vSWITCH, comunicating with the physical NIC. The vNIC is used also by the real OS because it&apos;s physical NIC is busy doing the vSWITCH.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="./assets/virtual-network.png">
</p>
The Virtual Disk is a file of fixed size or dynamically expanding. The vOS can be shared among the VMs and stored elsewhere than in the vdisk file. Each write goes on the vdisk (can undo all the write ops), instead each read first look in the &quot;file&quot; where the vOS is, than in the vdisk file if the previous check wasn&apos;t successful. I can also freeze the virtual disk, and extend the file with the software I want to add, making also rollback possible. This file abstraction for the disk makes also possible the application of a copy on write mechanism. I can use the same portion of file to save an operating system, and then create only one virtual disk file containing the differences between the various virtual machine and the original disk (more or less like image layering in Docker*). 
<p>The Virtual CPU masks the feature of a CPU to a VM. The VCPU can be overbooked, up to twice the number of cores. The CPU has several rings of protection (user ... nested vos,vos,os).</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="vram-balooning">vRAM balooning</h4>

<p>It&apos;s not allowed to use a virtual memory as vRAM because the sum of the vRAM should be less or equal to the actual RAM. Fragmentation could be a problem if there is lot of unused reserved memory. In order to achive this, a technique called balooning has been introduced.<br>
It is sayd to the VM: &quot;Look, you have 1TB of RAM but most of it it&apos;s occupied&quot;. In this way we have dynamically expanding blocks of RAM: if the OS needs memory I can deflate the baloon by moving the occupancy threshold.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="docker">Docker</h4>

<p>It exploits Linux&apos;s Resource Group. The processes in the container can see only a part of the OS. The containers have to share the networking. Docker separates different software stacks on a single node.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="control-layer">Control Layer</h3>

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/control-layer.png">
</p>
<p>The control layer includes control software that are <strong>responsible for managing and controlling  the underlying cloud infrastructure resources and enable provisioning of IT resources</strong> for creating cloud services. Control layer can be deployed on top of the virtual layer or on top of the physical layer. This layer receives request from the service and orchestration layers, and interacts with the underlying virtual and physical resources for provisioning IT resources. For example, <strong>when a consumer initiates a service request (a VM instance with 4 GB RAM and 500 GB storage), based on the workflow defined by the orchestration layer for this service, the control layer provisions the required resources from the resource pool to fulfill the service request</strong>. This layer also exposes the resources (physical and/or virtual) to and supports the service layer where cloud services interfaces are exposed to the consumers.</p>
<p>The <strong>key functions</strong> of the control layer includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>resource <strong>configuration</strong></li>
<li>resource <strong>provisioning</strong></li>
<li><strong>monitoring</strong> resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summarizing, <strong>control software</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enables <strong>resource configuration</strong> and resource <strong>pool configuration</strong></li>
<li>Enables resource <strong>provisioning</strong></li>
<li>Executes <strong>requests</strong> generated <strong>by service layer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exposes resources</strong> to and supports the service layer</li>
<li>Collaborates with the virtualization software and enables:

<li><strong>Resource pooling</strong> and creating <strong>virtual resources</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic allocation</strong> of resources</li>

</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="key-phases-for-provisioning-resources">Key phases for provisioning resources</h4>

<ul>
<li>Resource <strong>discovery</strong>: create an inventory of the infrastructure resources, so that unified manager can learn what resources are available for cloud service deployment</li>
<li>Resource <strong>pool management</strong>: virtual resources such as VM, virtual volume, and virtual network are created from these pools and provisioned for the services</li>
<li>Resource <strong>provisioning</strong>: involves allocating resources from graded resource pools to the service instances</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="thin-provisioning">Thin provisioning</h4>

<p>This is a <strong>virtualization technology</strong> that gives the <strong>appearance of having more physical resources than are actually available</strong>. Thin provisioning allows space to be easily allocated to servers, on a just-enough and just-in-time basis. Thin provisioning is called &quot;sparse volumes&quot; in some contexts.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="open-stack">Open stack</h4>

<p>A <strong>free and open-source software platform for cloud computing</strong>, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), whereby virtual servers and other resources are made available to customers.</p>
<p><strong>Good idea but bad implementation</strong>. Various open source softwares, difficult to deply, lots of dead code, bad security implementation. It has a small form of orchestration but it&apos;s not a service orchestrator (i.e. no distribution of the workload, scaling)</p>

<p align="center">

</p>
<p><strong>What is a cloud service?</strong><br>
Cloud services are IT resources that are packaged by the service providers and are offered to the consumers. Once constituent IT resources are provisioned and configured, a service is instantiated.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="service-layer-1">Service layer</h4>

<p>The service layer has three key functions which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enables defining services in a service catalog</strong>: cloud service providers should ensure that the consumers are able to view the available services, service level options, and service cost that will help them effectively to make the right choice of services. Cloud services are defined in a <strong>service catalog</strong>, which is a menu of services offerings from a service provider. The catalog provides a central source of information on the service offerings delivered to the consumers by the provider, so that the consumers can get a standard, accurate and consistent view of services that are available to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enables on-demand, self-provisioning of services</strong>: a service catalog also allows a consumer to request or order a service from the catalog that best matches the consumer&#x2019;s need <strong>without manual interaction with a service provider</strong>. While placing a service request, a consumer commonly submits service demands, such as required resources, needed configurations, and location of data. Once a service request is approved by the provider, appropriate resources are provisioned for the requested service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Presents cloud interfaces to consume services</strong>: cloud interfaces are the functional interfaces and the <strong>management</strong> interfaces of the deployed service instances. Using these interfaces, the consumers perform computing activities, such as executing a transaction and administer their use of rented service instances, such as modifying, scaling, stopping, or restarting a service instance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="orchestration-layer">Orchestration layer</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Automated arrangement, coordination, and management of various system or component functions in a cloud infrastructure to provide and manage cloud services.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="cloud-portal">Cloud portal</h4>

<p>A cloud portal is an access (usually web-based) point to a cloud, which <strong>provides access to the service catalog</strong>, and facilitates <strong>self-service provisioning</strong> and ongoing access to the cloud interfaces. A cloud portal is also accessed by the cloud administrators to manage cloud infrastructure and the lifecycle of cloud services.</p>
<p>Once a service provisioning or management request is placed in the cloud portal, the <strong>portal routes the request to the orchestration layer</strong> where appropriate <strong>workflows are triggered to fulfill the request</strong>. The orchestration layer is the automation engine of the cloud infrastructure, which defines standardized workflows for process automation. The workflows help orchestrating the execution of various system functions across the cloud infrastructure to fulfill the request.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="orchestration-types">Orchestration types</h4>

<p>Tow different types of orchestration:</p>
<ul>
<li>low level: eg. installation of a new VM</li>
<li>high level: eg. configuration of the new VM. At the end of this process the VM will be up and running</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="orchestration-apis">Orchestration APIs</h4>

<p>APIs are used to perform activities such as:</p>
<ul>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="service-orchestration">Service orchestration</h4>

<p>Service orchestration provides several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saves service provisioning time</strong>: service orchestration reduces the time required to approve, configure, integrate, and provision resources and to coordinate among various service management teams. This helps rapid provisioning of services.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminates possibility of manual errors</strong>: manual approach to service management is subject to errors and difficult to audit. Manual management also raises risk of deviating from increasingly stringent compliance requirements and service qualities. Service orchestration automates the coordination of system functions, which eliminates the risk of human error.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces operating expenses</strong>: service orchestration reduces administration cost through end-to-end automation of service provisioning and consequently decreases the cost of providing cloud services.</li>
<li><strong>Simplifies cloud infrastructure management</strong>: many common repetitive manual management activities are orchestrated in a cloud environment. Reduction of manual activities simplifies the administration of infrastructure resources and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although some manual steps (performed by cloud administrators) may be required while processing the service provisioning and management functions, service providers are looking to <strong>automate these functions as much as possible</strong>.</p>
<p>Cloud service providers typically deploy a purpose-designed <strong>orchestration software or orchestrator</strong> that orchestrates the execution of various system functions. <strong>The orchestrator programmatically integrates and sequences various system functions into automated workflows</strong> for executing higher-level service provisioning and management functions provided by the cloud portal. The orchestration workflows are <strong>not only meant for fulfilling requests from consumers</strong> but <strong>also for administering cloud infrastructure</strong>, such as <strong>adding resources to a resource pool, handling service-related issues, scheduling a backup for a service, billing, and reporting</strong>.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="./assets/business-continuity-layer.png">
</p>
<p>Business continuity is a set of processes that includes <strong>all activities</strong> that a business must perform to <strong>mitigate the impact of service outage</strong>. Business continuity entails preparing for, responding to, and recovering from a system outage that adversely affects business operations. It describes the processes and procedures a service provider establishes to <strong>ensure that essential functions can continue during and after a disaster</strong>. Business continuity prevents interruption of mission-critical services, and reestablishes the impacted services as swiftly and smoothly as possible by using an automated process. Business continuity involves <strong>proactive measures</strong>, such as business impact analysis, risk assessment, building resilient IT infrastructure, deploying data protection solutions (<strong>backup and replication</strong>). It also involves <strong>reactive countermeasures</strong>, such as disaster recovery, to be invoked in the event of a service failure. Disaster recovery (DR) is the coordinated process of restoring IT infrastructure, including data that is required to support ongoing cloud services, after a natural or human-induced disaster occurs.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="single-point-of-failure">Single point of failure</h4>

<p>Single points of failure refers to any individual component or aspect of an infrastructure whose failure can make the entire system or service unavailable. Single points of failure may occur at infrastructure component level and site level (data center).</p>
<p>Methods to avoid Singole Points of Failure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redundancy</li>
<li>Multiple service availablity zones</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="redundancy-1">Redundancy</h4>

<p>Redundancy is a technique used to <strong>avoid single point of failure</strong>. <strong>N+1 redundancy</strong> is a common form of fault tolerance mechanism that ensures service availability in the event of a component failure. A set of N components has at least one standby component. This is typically implemented as an <strong>active/passive</strong> arrangement, as the additional component does not actively participate in the service operations. The standby component is active only if any one of the active components fails. N+1 redundancy with <strong>active/active</strong> component configuration is also available. In such cases, the standby component remains active in the service operation even if all other components are fully functional. For example, if active/active configuration is implemented at the site level, then a cloud service is fully deployed in both the sites. The load for this cloud service is balanced between the sites. If one of the site is down, the available site would manage the service operations and manage the workload.</p>
<p>Be careful to <strong>active/passive failure</strong>, when a system fails but also the &quot;passive&quot; part fails immediatly because any checks have been executed.</p>
<p><strong>Key techniques to protect compute</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clustering (Two common clustering implementations are: Active/active ; Active/passive)</li>
<li><a href="#live-migration-of-a-vm">VM live migration</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key techniques to protect network connectivity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link and switch <strong>aggregation</strong> (cross connection)
<ul>
<li>Link aggregation: <strong>combines two or more parallel network links into a single logical link</strong>, called port-channel, yielding higher bandwidth than a single link could provide. Link aggregation enables distribution of network traffic across the links and traffic failover in the event of a link failure. If a link in the aggregation is lost, all network traffic on that link is redistributed across the remaining links.</li>
<li>Switch aggregation: <strong>combines two physical switches and makes them appear as a single logical switch</strong>. All network links from these physical switches appear as a single logical link. This enables a single node to use a port-channel across two switches and network traffic is distributed across all the links in the port-channel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NIC teaming</strong>: groups NICs so that they appear as a single, logical NIC to the OS or hypervisor</li>
<li><strong>Multipathing</strong>: enables a compute system to use multiple paths for transferring data to a LUN on a storage system</li>
<li><strong>In-service software upgrade</strong>: is a technique where the software (firmware) on a network device (switch and router) can be patched or upgraded without impacting the network availability</li>
<li>Configuring <strong>redundant hot swappable components</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key techniques to protect storage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>RAID and erasure coding</li>
<li>Dynamic disk sparing</li>
<li>Configuring redundant storage system components</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="service-availability-zones">Service Availability Zones</h4>

<p>A service availability zone is a <strong>location with its own set of resources and isolated from other zones</strong> to avoid that a failure in one zone will not impact other zones. A zone can be a part of a data center or may even be comprised of the whole data center. This provides redundant cloud computing facilities on which applications or services can be deployed.</p>
<p>Service providers typically <strong>deploy multiple zones within a data center</strong> (to run multiple instances of a service), so that if one of the zone incurs outage due to some reasons, then the service can be failed over to the other zone. They also <strong>deploy multiple zones across geographically dispersed data centers</strong> (to run multiple instances of a service), so that the service can survive even if the failure is at the data center level. It is also important that there should be a mechanism that allows seamless (automated) failover of services running in one zone to another.</p>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="live-migration-of-a-vm">Live Migration of a VM</h4>

<p>Moving a VM from server A to B (from hypervisor A to hypervisor B) while it&apos;s running. The user could experience a degradation of the service but not a disruption.</p>
<p>In a VM live migration <strong>the entire active state of a VM is moved from one hypervisor to another</strong>. The state information includes memory contents and all other information that identifies the VM. This method involves copying the contents of VM memory from the source hypervisor to the target and then transferring the control of the VM&#x2019;s disk files to the target hypervisor. Next, the VM is suspended on the source hypervisor, and the VM is resumed on the target hypervisor. Because the virtual disks of the VMs are not migrated, this technique requires that both source and target hypervisors have access to the same storage. Performing VM live migration requires a high speed network connection. It is important to ensure that even after the migration, the VM network identity and network connections are preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Live migration</strong> summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy the <strong>RAM</strong> and at the end, copy the <strong>pages</strong> writed during this phase.</li>
<li>create an empty drive on B</li>
<li>copy the <strong>CPU registers</strong> (the VM is stopped for a really short period)</li>
<li>manage vSwitch and ARP protocol. The virtual switch must be aware of the migration: if the old vSwitch receives a packet for the just migrated VM it should forward it to B.</li>
<li>continue running the VM on B, only when it needs the disk you stop it and start copying the disk file. A jumboframe can be used to avoid storage traffic fragmentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process is a little bit easier if both the VMs use a shared storage.</p>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="backups">Backups</h4>

<p>It&apos; a data <strong>protection solution</strong>, and it should be automatized. It has become a crucial point in data center management to the extent in which cloud provider have started providing Backup-aaS and DisasterRecovery-aaS.</p>
<p>With <strong>replicas are  data protection solutions</strong>. This task becomes more challenging with the growth of data, reduced IT budgets, and less time available for taking backups. Moreover, service providers need fast backup and recovery of data to meet their service level agreements. The amount of data loss and downtime that a business can endure in terms of <strong>RPO and RTO are the primary considerations</strong> in selecting and implementing a specific backup strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RTO (Recovery Time Objective)</strong>: time it will take to have a full recovery. Relates to the time taken to recover data from backup</li>
<li><strong>RPO (Recovery Point Objective)</strong>: what is the last consistent copy of the storage I will find. How many data points do you have to go back in time? specifies the time interval between two backups. Is defined by business continuity planning. It is the maximum targeted period in which data might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident (DR - Disaster Recovery).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network</strong> is the <strong>first problem</strong> when I want to make a backup, beacuse the <strong>size of the backup</strong> is bigger than the network bandwidth. Sometimes it&apos;s simply impossible to make a backup.</p>
<p>Backup types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Incremental backup</strong>: backup <strong>only the updated parts</strong>. High RTO cause I have to reconstruct all the files hierarchy going back througth the back ups. Sometimes snapshots are needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guest level</strong>: a VM is treated as if it is a physical compute system. A <strong>backup agent is installed on the VM</strong>, and it streams the backup data to the storage node. If multiple VMs on a compute system are backed up simultaneously, then the combined I/O and bandwidth demands placed on the compute system by the various guest-level backup operations can deplete the compute system resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image level:</strong>  uses <strong>snapshots</strong>. It&apos;s <strong>agentless</strong> (agent == client who gathers the data that is to be backed up), the agent can&apos;t crash since there isn&apos;t one. The backup processing is performed by a proxy server that acts as the backup client. Backup is saved as a single entity called a VM image. Provides VM image-level and file-level recovery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backup as a Service</strong>: service providers offer backup as a service that enables an organization to reduce its backup management overhead. It also enables the individual consumer to perform backup and recovery anytime, from anywhere, using a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Backup window</strong>: the horizon effect: you decide a window but the stuff you need will be always in the deleted part.</p>
<p><strong>Data Deduplication</strong>: the process of detecting and <strong>identifying the unique data segments</strong> (chunk) within a given set of data <strong>to eliminate redundancy</strong>. The use of deduplication techniques significantly reduces the amount of data to be backed up in a cloud environment, where typically a large number of VMs are deployed. <strong>Take the hash of two identical files</strong>, <strong>store only one</strong> of the two files <strong>and both the hashes</strong>. If the same file is required in two context, it is saved one time and is served to different context.</p>
<p><strong>Replica</strong>: the process of creating an <strong>exact copy</strong> of the data.

<p>The fundamental requirements of information security and compliance pertain to both non-cloud and cloud infrastructure management. In both the environments, there are some common security requirements. However, in a cloud environment there are important additional factors, which a service provider must consider, that arise from information ownership, responsibility and accountability for information security, and the cloud infrastructure&#x2019;s multi-tenancy characteristic. Therefore, <strong>providing secure multi-tenancy is a key requirement</strong> for building a cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>Cloud service management has a service-based focus, meaning that the <strong>management functions are linked to the service requirements and service level agreement</strong> (SLA). Be <strong>aware of regulations and legal constraints</strong> that define how to run a system. Is this system behaving according to the regulations? Recap that information processors (cloud providers) are responsible of the data they process.</p>
<p><strong>SLA</strong> Service Level Agreement: legal contract that you sign as a customer to the provider defining what the user is paying for.</p>
<p><strong>Service availability</strong> = 1 - (downtime/ agreed service time)<br>
The uptime is difficult to define and to test because the reachability of the cloud depend also from the service providers.</p>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="capacity-planning-management">Capacity Planning/ Management</h4>

<p>Capacity Planning/ Management: make some forecast to find when we will exhaust the resources and how many resources we will really need.  Ensure that a cloud infrastructure is able to <strong>meet the required capacity demands</strong> for cloud services in a cost effective and timely manner.</p>
<p>Common Methods to Maximize Capacity Utilization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource <strong>pooling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Over-commitment</strong> of processor cycles and memory (it can bring to capacity issues)</li>
<li>Automated VM <strong>load balancing</strong> across hypervisors</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic scheduling</strong> of virtual processors across processing cores</li>
<li><strong>Thin provisioning</strong></li>
<li>Automated <strong>storage tiering</strong></li>
<li>Dynamic VM <strong>load balancing across storage volumes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Converged network</strong></li>
<li><strong>Automatic reclamation</strong> of capacity when a service is terminated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: collecting data (in a respectfull way). Availability Monitoring, Capacity Monitoring, Performance Monitoring, Security Monitoring.</p>
<p>Monitoring <strong>benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps to track the availability and <strong>performance</strong> status of infrastructure components and services</li>
<li>Helps to analyze the <strong>utilization</strong> and consumption of resources by service instances</li>
<li>Helps to track <strong>events</strong> that <strong>may impact availability</strong> and performance</li>
<li>Helps in <strong>metering</strong>, <strong>reporting</strong>, and <strong>alerting</strong></li>
<li>Helps to present information as service <strong>metrics to consumers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of <strong>Performance-related Changes</strong>:</p>

<h3 class="mume-header" id="question">Question</h3>

<p>Discuss the difference between spine and leaf fabric and the more traditional fabric architecture based on larger chassis. How bandwidth and latency are affected?</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="solution">Solution</h3>

<h2 class="mume-header" id="spine-and-leaf">Spine and Leaf</h2>

<p>Non modular, fixed switches are interconnected with some MLAG (Multi-chassis Link Aggregation). Loosely copuled form of aggregation: the two switches are independent and share some form of aggregation. Each leaf is connected to all the spines (if the leaf has 6 upwards ports, 2 are used to connect the two coupled switches in the leaf ,the others are used to the connection with the spine). At least 2 spines for redundancy. The spines are not connected each other.<br>
LACP protocol allowing to bind multiple links to a single conceptual link (link aggregation, active-active).<br>
<strong>over-subscription</strong> the links to the spine should be able to sustain the trafic coming from all the links below. This is not a problem for EW trafic between servers attached to the same switch (because the link to the spine is not affected).<br>
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>resilient</li>
<li>active-active</li>
<li>can be uptdated while the system is running</li>
</ul>
<p>It became popular after 10 GBps; before it was difficult to use it with 4/8/16 ports per server. Different VLANs are used.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Chassis</strong><br>
Tipically two modular chassis connected by two links (STP) in atcive-passive (the second chassis goes up only when the first isn&apos;t working). The ration between the number of ports and the bandwidth is completely different from spine and leaf. Link aggregation is possible but it&apos;s not convenient.<br>
Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>room for growing</li>
<li>protection on the investment</li>
<li>share power</li>
<li>pay only once and just add line cards</li>
<li>simplifying the power supply cabling</li>
</ul>
<p>Today is not so much used because it&apos;s difficult to design a backplane offering terabits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capex and Opex reasons</strong>: in active-passive I use only half of the bandwidth I&apos;m paying for.</li>
<li><strong>latency issues</strong>: with STP when a link goes down it can take up to seconds to activate the other link.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Latency</strong><br>
With spine and leaf we introduce more hops, so more latency, than the chassis approach. The solution for this problem is using as a base of the spine a huge switch (256 ports) which actually acts as a chassis, in order to reduce the number of hops and latency.</p>
<p><strong>Bandwidth</strong><br>
To enlarge the bandwidth in a spine and leaf architecture we need only to add a new spine and to connect to all leaves. With the chassis approach we can add bandwidth adding new line cards (new switches) to the chassis, provided that there are free slots in the chassis.<br>
In the spine and leaf arch we can upgrade a spine reducing the bandwidth, but still without disrupting the connectivity. In the traditional chassis an upgrade degrades the bandwidth =&gt; TODO: verify.</p>

<h3 class="mume-header" id="question-3">Question</h3>

<p>A service requires a sustained throughput towards the storage of 15 GB/s. Would you recomment using a SAN architecture or an hyperconvergent one.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="solution-3">Solution</h3>

<ul>
<li>15 GB is the max bandwidth of a PCI express bus with 16 lanes.</li>
<li>100 Gbps bandwidth of a single link (even if internally is 4*25 Gbps).</li>
<li>15 GBps * 8 = 120 Gbps</li>
<li>The PCI has some overhead, so it&apos;s bandwidth is not fully 15 GB.</li>
<li>15 GB = 54 TB/hour = 1 PB/day = half exaB / year. I have also to consider where am Is going to store this data, not focusing only on the bandwidth.</li>
<li>8/ 10 TB mechanical drive capacity.</li>
<li>SATA SSD has 500 MB bandwidth.</li>
<li>With 15 GB/sec, 4 fiber channel are enough.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SAN area network (recap)</strong><br>
ISCSI internet protocol (SCSI on fiber) allows to mount blocks/disks.<br>
Block-based access: you mount a chunk of bytes seen as a drive.<br>
LUN (Logical UNits), can be replicated, compression can be used, it can be overbooked.<br>
Servers and drives are separated, drives are pooled togheter.</p>
<p>SAN today is failing because the bandwidth of the drives saturates the links, making it impossible to pool a lot of drives.</p>
<p><strong>NAS</strong><br>
It uses istead a network file system protocol to access the pooled resources (SIFS, NFS). We access files not blocks.<br>
NAS gives the file system, with SAN I decide the FS.<br>
Security in SAN is bounded to the compute OS, which decide the authentication domain.<br>
Instead NAS has the responsibility of the security and the filesystem abstraction(Active Directory and NFS security).</p>
<p>Both SAN and NAS separate the storage from the compute. Configure one for all the storage (backup, compression...) and look at it as blocks or files.<br>
This architecture is failing because of the throughput of the drive (very fast) that saturates the link.</p>
<p><strong>HCI (hyperconvergent)</strong><br>
Before we talked about three independent units: compute, storage and network. With  HCI istead we have boxes (servers) with a little bit of network, drive and compute.</p>
<p>It&apos;s not true that the compute and the drive are completely unrelated and can be completely separated: also the CPUs have their own limits in data processing even if large (risk to waist resources).</p>
<p>HCI by Nutanix allows to simply add a bit of storage, a bit of compute and a bit of network by buying a server. You pay as you grow and lower the risk, since you don&apos;t have to make capacity planning.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong><br>
The choice depends also on the kind of data I assume to process (assume at least one: sensors, bank financial data ...). For example HCI is not convenient if a want to do archiving because I pay for extra unused CPU.</p>
<p>It&apos;s not enough to say: I take 5 big drives, because their bandwidth can be a bottleneck.</p>
<p>SAN could be the good solution because it&apos;s cheaper. SAN can be used with <strong>tiering</strong>: in the first layer I keep SSD &quot;buffers&quot;,  in the second layer mechanical drives. If I keep a buffer of 1TB I&apos;ll have 6 minutes to copy down the buffered data to the mech drives.<br>
Assuming 24 Gbps of incoming bandwidth and 1 TB of SSD buffer.<br>
24 Gbps = 3 GBps --&gt; 1000 Gb /3 = 330 s to saturate the buffer.<br>
Netxt to the buffer there are mech drives (130/150 MBps)<br>
I write to the SSD 3000 MBps but I copy to the drive (assuming just 1) 150 MBps. So the incoming bandwidth in the buffer is 3000 -150 = 2850 MB/s.<br>
With one mech drive I will saturate the disk in 1000 GB / 2.8 GBps = 360 s = 6 min</p>
<p>If I consider the text of the exercise, in particular &apos;towards&apos;, as in the sense of &quot;only writing&quot;, imagining to have to almost only archive data and read only from time to time, I can actually consider SAN, because if I go hyperconvergent I am paying also for the CPU which might be unused. If I instead have a balance between r/w and want a good throughput for both operations, or I have a peek and then a flatter period of time with few action, then I might choose better going hyperconvergent.</p>
<p><strong>What should I look for..</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capex Opex</li>
<li>Resilience</li>
<li>Bandwidth (network, drives)</li>
<li>etc...</li>

<h2 class="mume-header" id="5-dimension-a-hyperconvergent-system">5) Dimension a hyperconvergent system</h2>

<h3 class="mume-header" id="question-4">Question</h3>

<p>A service requires a sustained throughput towards the storage of 15 GB/s. How would you dimension an hyperconvergent system to ensure it works properly?</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="solution-4">Solution</h3>

<p>Look first at the network (fabric is the glue of the infrastructure). Can&apos;t have 100 GBps straight to the server because of spine and leaf, so I have to consider the idea of distribution (hyperconvergent).</p>
<p>Recap that:</p>
<ul>
<li>just 1 or 2 ports of 100Gbps are enough to saturate the PCIe.</li>
<li>not good to have 100Gbps for each node cause I&apos;m overloading that single node while HCI is distributed</li>
</ul>
<p>First I have to choose the Ethernet bandwidth between (10-25-50-100-400), considering that 400 Gbps is achievable only on the spine, and not on the leaves.<br>
Better 10 Gbps or 25Gbps depending on CAPEX.<br>
With spine and leaf I have 50 Gbps  cause I double (active-active).</p>
<p><strong>Some calculations</strong><br>
We have 15 GB/s incoming bandwidth --&gt;  15 * 8 = 120 Gbps<br>
We first dimension a spine and leaf architecture to sustain this bandwidth value.<br>
We have a couple of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 Gbps per server (hyperconvergent node)</li>
<li>25 Gbps per server (we choose this)</li>
</ul>
<p>To cover 120 Gbps we need at least 5 nodes --&gt; 5*25 = 125 Gbps</p>
<p>We could also add more (up to 8-10) nodes to have redundancy and efficiency, but we will consider 5 in the calculations</p>
<p>Every HCI node will have some SSD (as buffer) and some mechanical drives.</p>
<p>Since we have 120 Gbps totally each node will receive 120 / 5 = 24 Gbps storage bandwidth<br>
This is ok since the link to the node is 25Gbps (even if we have active-active configuration so the actual bandwidth is 50 Gbps)</p>
<p>Now we must consider the number of drives in each node. The drive throughput must sustain the incoming bandwidth  of 24Gbps to avoid data loss. We know that SSD drives have a bandwidth of 500 MBps, so half a GB.<br>
So 24 Gbps / 8 = 3 GBps</p>
<ul>
<li>#disks * (1/2 GBps) = 3 GBps --&gt; #disks = 6</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that bandwidth are not fully used because of some overhead..(e.g. to connect two spine nodes together)</p>

<p>1024 Servers need to be connected with any of the following switch options: 48x25Gbps East/West Traffic with 6 x 100 Gbps for North/South (and two other configs to choose from). Oversubcription level can be up to 1/6. Which network Topology would you choose? Discuss its pros and cons.<br>
<em>I gave a couple but he was more interested to see one discussed in thorough detail. So not to recite theory but to be able to apply the knowledge from the section above. for 1024, 48x25, oversubscr 1/6. I went for spine/leaf model and he wanted to know how many switches  would be  required  in that  case (do not forget redudancy causes doubling + two links of the 6 will be gone for connecting the two spines together)</em></p>

<p>How does live migration of a VM happen and would you prefer to do it over HCI or SAN?<br>
<em>as long as no detail is provided, you are allowed to make your own assumptions. - I said both should be effectively the same given that bandwidth would not be blocked and that we are using latest/fastest technology. Crucial part of the VM Migration was (apart from copying config files, moving virtual registers and  halting the old machine for a millisecond) is that copying the files happens in the background. If a file is required to complete a process and it has still not been migrated, the new VM goes and fetches it first from the old VM before it continues with copying any other file</em></p>

<li>
<p>Discuss the role (functions) of the orchestration layer. Give an example workflow. where does it lie in the cloud stack?<br>
<em>check the slides for sure, they are very helpful! A process I gave was provisioning an Alexa skill on AWS which requires building a Lambda function (an AWS service) and a Skill controller. I think he was happy to have a real-life example. Draw the workflow like a business process from the point of provisioning to the billing etc.</em></p>
